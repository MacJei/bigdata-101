•	Upload dataset on HDFS;
•	Write MR jobs to count amount of all the tags in the dataset (use your user.profile.tags.us.txt from HDP to map TAGs with dataset like dataset_User Tags = user.profile.tags.us.txt_Id, try to use combiner & distributed cache). 
Save the output in text files on HDFS with rows as follow: TAG,COUNT;
•	Write MR jobs to count amount of visits (count(*)) by IP and spends (sum(Bidding price)) by IP (try to use combiner & custom writable data type). 
Save output as Sequence file compressed with Snappy (key is IP, and value is custom object for visits and spends);
•	Add MR Unit tests for your Mapper/Reducer
•	Use counters to get stats how many records of IE, FireFox, Opera, Chrome or other browser were detected,
parse it from UserAgent string:
